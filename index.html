            <h3>Traditional Thai Massage</h3>

            <p>Nuad Bo Rarn, or Traditional Thai Massage, is an ancient form of bodywork that has roots in Ayrvedic medicine - the traditional medicine of India. It consists of deep compressions and full-body passive stretches to bring deep mental and physical relaxation to one's body.</p>

            <h3>Swedish Massage</h3>
            <p>
              A Swedish massage is the classical style of Western massage which uses lotion or oil to glide over the body. It incorporates a combination of 5 basic strokes: effleurage, petrissage, friction, vibration/shaking, and tapotement, to relieve muscle tension and promote relaxation.

            <h3>Motor Vehicle Accident Massage</h3>
            <p>
              In the unfortunate event that you should get in a car accident, drivers are entitled to massage therapy which automotive insurance companies cover, even if you are at fault. Receiving a series of massage treatments shortly after an accident greatly reduces the chance of lifetime chronic pains. Here at Fantastic Massage, our licensed massage therapists are specially trained to treat injuries and soft-tissue tension patterns that can occur from car accidents.

            <h3>Pre-Natal Massage</h3>
            <p>
              A woman's body changes dramatically throughout pregnancy, and new and increased levels of tension arise as a result. Prenatal massage is an incredibly effective method of treating the extra strain on the mother's body and mind.

            <h3>Sports Massage</h3>
            <p>
              Sports massage consists of manipulation of soft tissue of the body, and focuses on areas that are specific to the athlete's sport/activity.  It can be used for pre-event preparation in order to warm the tissues up and 'awaken' them.  Post-event massage is used for recovery, and can be performed immediately after your event/activity, or up to a few days after.

              Human bodies work hard to get through the day. We get stressed, injured, depressed, and at times, sedentary. Tissues harden and become inflamed, and muscles don't receive proper nutrients, causing pain and spasms. Massage helps combat these while elevating our well-being. While massage may not save your life, we can improve and prolong the quality of it.
